ðŸš€ Built My First Vehicle Entry Management System! ðŸš€

I identified a real-world challengeâ€”my father was facing difficulty in storing vehicle entries. To solve this, I designed and developed a system that simplifies the process.

While I had the solution in mind, I needed assistance with coding. Leveraging AI tools like Cursor, I was able to bring my idea to life and successfully implement the system. This project not only helped me enhance my problem-solving skills but also deepened my understanding of coding and technology.

Excited to keep learning and building more! ðŸ”¥
